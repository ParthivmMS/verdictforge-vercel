        <p className="mb-4">
          For years, law students and junior advocates have struggled through endless pages of judgments.
          We copy-paste from SCC Online, Manupatra, or court websites… then read… re-read… summarize by hand.

        <p className="mb-4">
          It’s exhausting. While legal knowledge is essential, the system makes it inefficient. 
          Reading judgments should feel like gaining insight — not surviving a punishment.
